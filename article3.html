        <p class="articles-text">
          King Wapol, the former ruler of Drum Island, is a character defined by his insatiable greed for power and wealth. As a tyrant, he prioritizes his own desires above the well-being of his subjects. Wapol's reign is marked by corruption, oppression, and a complete disregard for the lives of his people. <br><br>
          However, King Wapol's character is not merely one-dimensional. Despite his despicable actions, his motivations and backstory provide insights into the complexities of his personality. Understanding the reasons behind Wapol's behavior adds layers of depth to his character, even if it does not excuse his actions. <br><br>
          Throughout the story, King Wapol's interactions with the Straw Hat Pirates and other characters further highlight his selfishness and disregard for others. His clashes with Luffy and his crew expose the stark contrast between their values and emphasize the importance of friendship and camaraderie. King Wapol serves as a reminder of the consequences of unchecked ambition and serves as a cautionary tale within the One Piece world.
